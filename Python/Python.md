# Section 1: Intro to Python
## Variables

Useful to dynamically set or change value in variables.
```python
age = 30 # A variable 'age' storing value 30.
print(age) # displays 30 in the console.
age = 40
print(age) # display 40 in the console.
```

**Snake(underscore**) naming convention  is suggested. 
eg:
```python
friends_age = 22
counties_visited = 9
```

**Capital Case** preferred when naming constants. 
```python
PI = 3.14
RADIANS_TO_DEGREES = 180 / PI
```

# Numbers
Two types of numbers: **Whole Numbers** and **Floating Numbers**.
```python
age = 35 # whole number (integer)
PI = 3.14159 # decimal number (float)
```

## Mathematical Operations
Precedence is in accordance with **BODMAS** rule.
Note: division always returns float.

/ -> float division
// -> integer division

## Strings
